## Let's start

The first step would be to go to file explorer > My Computer > User > .ssh

<Frame>

</Frame>

We enter the folder

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/5.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

and open the "id_rsa.pub" file with a notepad

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/6.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

This line would be the key you would have to copy and send us to add it so you can access your space in the cloud.

## You do not get the .ssh folder?

This is because we have never accessed a server via ssh or sftp, but we can generate it for this purpose, we have to open a cmd

  <img src="/images/3.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

type the command "ssh-keygen" and press enter to create the default, we do not need to type anything special, once you do this, the .ssh folder will appear.
